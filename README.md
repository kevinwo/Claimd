![Claimd: Memberships for You](https://github.com/kevinwo/Claimd/blob/main/ClamdWordmarkLogo.jpg?raw=true)

Claimd is a mobile-first membership claiming application built during the [February 2024 Thirdweb Consumer Crypto Hackathon](https://thirdweb.com/hackathon/consumer-crypto).

# Goals

I've been excited about possible uses for on-chain memberships in real life over the past year, and have been thinking about what to build around this. As part of the hackathon, I decided to focus on membership onboarding, and see if I could achieve the following with Thirdweb on iOS:

- [x] One
- [x] Two
- [x] Three
- [ ] Four

# Tech Stack

- React Native
- Thirdweb SDK
- Next.js
